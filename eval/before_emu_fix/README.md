All eval files here are obtained from runs before using the "fixed" emulator: https://github.com/StefanUPB/vim-emu

In this slightly modified version, all vLinks are routed correctly along shortest path regarding delay. Before, shortest paths were computed "somehow" (probably hop count).



So the files here may have very large differences in emulated and simulated delay due to different paths taken in emulation.
